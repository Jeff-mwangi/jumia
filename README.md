# Jumiya Ecommerce Website (Still underdevelopment)

Jumiya is an ecommerce website that allows users to browse, search, add to cart, and checkout various products. The application utilizes the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products) to fetch product data and provide a realistic shopping experience.
The website is built using the Django framework and JavaScript to create a seamless and interactive user interface. It offers a wide range of features to enhance the user experience and simplify the online shopping process.

# Features
**Product Catalog:** Browse and explore a vast catalog of products, including detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information.

**Search Functionality:** Easily find desired products by utilizing the search functionality, which allows users to search by product name, category, or any other relevant criteria.

**Shopping Cart:** Add products to the cart and manage the quantities of selected items. The cart dynamically updates with the latest prices and allows users to remove products if needed.

**User Authentication:** Register an account or log in to an existing account to access personalized features, such as managing addresses, reviewing order history, and saving favorites.
